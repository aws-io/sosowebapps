Overview and Key Achievements
Over the past year, I have focused on strengthening my skills and impact as a DevOps engineer, with an emphasis on security, container orchestration, API management, and observability through Elasticsearch. A significant portion of my contributions involved supporting internal clients by integrating their logs into our Elasticsearch environment, ensuring enhanced visibility and operational efficiency.
Despite a three-month paternity leave beginning in August, I successfully delivered critical projects and continued to build my expertise, notably earning the Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect (SC-100) certification during my leave to further expand my cloud security capabilities.

Key Goals and Accomplishments
•	Deployed and configured a Vault server to manage secrets and sensitive data across environments, reinforcing the organization’s security infrastructure as a PoC.
•	Designed and deployed a proof of concept for Istio as a service mesh on our sandbox Kubernetes cluster. This enhanced traffic management, service-to-service security, and observability across microservices.
•	Supported IBM API Connect upgrades, ensuring smooth integration and improved API lifecycle management for internal clients.
4. Elasticsearch Logs Support:
•	Elasticsearch support and integration efforts, responded to and resolved ServiceNow tickets related to Elasticsearch log ingestion, indexing, and querying.
•	Worked closely with internal clients to integrate their server and application logs into our Elasticsearch environment, enhancing monitoring, troubleshooting, and data visibility.
•	Streamlined log parsing, enriched data pipelines, and optimized dashboard configurations, resulting in faster issue resolution and better insight into distributed systems.

Focus Areas for the Coming Year
In the upcoming year, I plan to continue building on the progress made, with specific focus on the following areas:
•	Advanced Elasticsearch Management:
o	Drive further improvements in log ingestion, alerting, and dashboard configurations to enhance system observability.
o	Implement automated pipelines and AI-driven anomaly detection to proactively identify issues.
•	Istio and Service Mesh Technologies (Envoy):
o	Expand Istio integration across production environments to enhance service security, traffic routing, and observability.
o	Deepen my knowledge of Envoy proxy configurations to optimize microservices communication.
•	Container Security and Compliance (IronBank):
o	Explore and integrate IronBank hardened containers to align with industry standards for secure deployments.
o	Ensure our containerized environments meet stringent security and compliance requirements, reflecting the needs of a health insurance company.
•	Cloud-Native Security and Observability:
o	Strengthen expertise in container security tools (e.g., Falco, Aqua Security) and expand observability using Prometheus and Grafana.
o	Focus on securing and scaling distributed applications across cloud environments.
