Accomplishments in 2024
Goals Achieved:
1.	Elastic Logs Support
Actively managed and resolved ServiceNow tickets related to Elasticsearch, providing prompt and efficient support for internal clients.
Streamlined logging processes, server integrations into Elasticsearch, improving monitoring capabilities and supporting the organization’s operational reliability.
2.	Container Orchestration
Implemented Istio as a proof of concept in the sandbox Kubernetes cluster, showcasing its potential for service mesh, observability, and traffic management.
3.	Secrets Management for Security
Deployed Vault to enhance secure secrets management across systems.
Laid the foundation for improving security workflows, with a plan to automate certificate renewals in the coming year.
4.	API Management
Supported IBM API Connect upgrades, ensuring the stability of internal API management systems and a smooth user experience for stakeholders.
5.	Continuous Learning and Development
Earned the Microsoft Azure Cybersecurity Architect certification -SC-300 during my paternity leave, enhancing my cloud security expertise.

What Made These Accomplishments Stand Out:
My problem-solving, particularly with Elasticsearch tickets and logging processes contributed directly to the department’s ability to maintain system reliability and meet client needs.
Innovative initiatives, such as the Istio proof of concept, positioned the organization to leverage advanced DevOps technologies.
By deploying Vault for secrets management, I laid the groundwork for automating certificate renewal, a critical step toward improving operational security and reducing manual overhead.

Goals That Were Not Fully Achieved
•	Istio Integration with Envoy:
o	While Istio was successfully set up as a proof of concept, integrating Envoy with Istio was not accomplished due to limited collaboration with the networking team. In the upcoming year, I aim to work closely with the networking team to better understand the technical requirements and enable successful Envoy integration into our Kubernetes clusters.
o	While the Vault server was deployed, automating certificate renewal remains a work in progress. This will be a primary focus for next year, as it directly supports operational security and efficiency.

Impact on the Organization
My work in the Elasticsearch support and ServiceNow ticket resolutions highlighted my ability to adapt and meet unanticipated challenges effectively, and the integrations that were done in Elasticsearch provide critical visibility into server operations and logging processes, significantly reducing troubleshooting time and enhancing system reliability.
I continue to learn and assist with supporting API Connect upgrades tasking like upgrades to ensure uninterrupted API services.
Introducing Istio as a proof of concept demonstrated my commitment to innovation, aligning with the organization’s broader transformation goals.
By deploying Vault and earning an advanced Azure cybersecurity certification, I strengthened our infrastructure's security posture—a key priority for a our organization.

Focus for 2025
Moving forward, I plan to continue driving value for the organization by:
Deepening Expertise: Expanding my knowledge of Elasticsearch, Istio, Envoy, and IronBank to deliver advanced container orchestration, secure infrastructure, and improved logging capabilities.
Scaling Innovation: Proposing scalable and secure implementations of tools like Vault, Kubernetes, and Elasticsearch to address evolving business needs.
Supporting Transformation: Partnering with internal teams to align technical initiatives with the company’s transformation goals and mission.
By focusing on these areas, I aim to enhance our middleware operations' reliability, scalability, and security, contributing meaningfully to our mission of delivering high-quality, innovative solutions.
